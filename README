Requirements  - Wordpress blog with xml-rpc publishing enabled.
                      - XMPP chat server (openfire)
                      - Python 2.5 with xmpp and xml-rpc library.
                      - Gammu SMS library version 1.27.0

Features     - Unicode enabled

This programs runs on a localhost xmpp server and logs all the messages sent to it on wordpress blog.
Its a sort of federated microblogging with a database backend. Useful for storming sessions.

ToDo      - Bot gets kicked off after being idle for 5 or 6 minutes on openfire server. Works well on gtalk server 
              - Needs to send 'KeepALive' packet.
              - After getting logged in, it posts 'None' as the first message. Need to remove it.
	     
 	     - Add some more scalability to the bot, ie instead of hardcoding the blog/user/passwd within the program, 
               should ask for it once and store it in the backend.
